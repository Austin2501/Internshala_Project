## To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

First, download and unzip the project files to your local system. You should have a folder named "carrental."

Place the "carrental" folder inside your web server's root directory. Depending on your server setup, this directory could be "xampp/htdocs" for XAMPP, "wamp/www" for WAMP, or "var/www/html" for LAMP.

## Database Configuration:

Access your PHPMyAdmin database management tool.

Create a new database named "carrental."

Import the database structure by using the provided SQL file. You can find the SQL file in the "SQL File" folder within the project's zip package.

## User Access:

To access the user interface:

Open your web browser and enter the following URL: "http://localhost/carrental."

Use the following user login details:

Username: test@gmail.com

## Admin Panel Access:

To access the admin panel:

Open your web browser and enter the following URL: "http://localhost/carrental/admin."

Please ensure that your web server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or LAMP) is running, and you have imported the database structure for the project to work correctly.
